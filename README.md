# Project Name: House Price Predictor

## Short description:
We have created this House predicting program as part of our exam project in Python.
Our program webscrapes the webside www.boliga.dk for almost all residences in denmark. We have specified the webscraper to only scrape specific houses, wich are the options for a user to choose when using the predictor.
The program is executed by running the file "/src/machinelearning/house_predictor.py" in the command line in VSC.
The user is prompted in the terminal for input regarding the house they want to price predict.

### List of used technologies:
 - Matplotlib
 - sklearn
 - cv2
 - numpy
 - pandas
 - requests
 - BeautifulSoup
 - threading
 - concurrent.futures

### Status:
 - We would have liked to implement a feature where not only the price was predicted, but also where five    similar houses was found in relation to the user house.
 - We would have liked to visualize more data from our dataset
 - We would have liked to test out more machine learning models. 
 
### List of Challenges
 - Webscraping
 - Machine learning
 - Threads
